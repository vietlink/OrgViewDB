/* This procedure is designed to overcome the limitation in the SQL print command that causes it to truncate strings longer than 8000 characters (4000 for nvarchar).

It will print the text passed to it in substrings smaller than 4000 characters. If there are carriage returns (CRs) or new lines (NLs in the text), it will break up the substrings at the carriage returns and the printed version will exactly reflect the string passed.

If there are insufficient line breaks in the text, it will print it out in blocks of 4000 characters with an extra carriage return at that point.

If it is passed a null value, it will do virtually nothing.

NOTE: This is substantially slower than a simple print, so should only be used when actually needed. */
